Starter app for Kinvey iOS 3.0 SDK

This is a iOS Sample app to illustrate how to use version 3.0 of the [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) iOS library.

* Managing offline data in a "Sync" store and synchronizing it with the backend

## Prerequisites

* Kinvey iOS library 3.0.0 (bundled in as a developer preview)
* [Kinvey](https://console.kinvey.com) app ID and secret. Before compiling, replace `appKey` and `appSecret` in the `AppDelegate` with values you obtain from the console.
